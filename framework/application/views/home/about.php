</strong><br/>Why pay for a hotel room when you can have the whole  Villa / Cottage? Enjoy the home conveniences you just don’t get in a hotel. For less than the cost of staying at a good hotel you can now enjoy the luxury of a beautiful private villa or home stay cottage with all modern day comfort, spacious living and dining areas. You may also get the luxury of large terraces, a lush tropical garden with your own private swimming pool, and a full-time personal staff to care you. Nearly every villa boasts fully-equipped kitchens with modern appliances, lavish amenities, spacious suites, stunning views & much more. Instead of staying in hotel rooms (bed, two chairs, dressing table, TV set and telephone, wardrobe, small bathroom), your family will enjoy true vacation by having more space, more informality, more privacy, and more personal service than even the best hotel can provide. <br/><br/>
<strong>All spaces are yours – Real Family Moments</strong></span><br/>
There are no "off-limit" areas in a private villa / Cottage. Imagine the luxury of having breakfast barefoot in your pyjamas, of choosing where and when your dinner should be served, or of staying late in the night partying together with your family or friends without any restrictions of time and space. These moments of your vacation you will cherish the most. The size of your villa depends on the size of your party, but no worries, our rentals range from intimate one bedroom villa / cottges to spacious 10-bedroom bungalows, so we can easily accommodate any group.<br/>
Compare a stay in a hotel where you find hotel neighbors, crowded pools and busy restaurants. During your stay in a villa or home stay, your villa belongs to you only. In a Villa, you can prepare your meals if you wish or you can enjoy the food made by trained  cook who can  prepare food of your choice. You are not locked into hotel menus and restaurant dining hours.  While in a Home Stay you can enjoy the local food made by the hosts which is typical to the vacation destination or you can ask your choice of food and the hospitality that is displayed by home stay owners you will find nowhere.<br/>
  We have plenty of pet friendly properties so absolutely no-one has to stay home.<br/><br/>
 <strong>Privacy</strong><br/>
Typically, villas are private homes where your neighbors are not on the other side of the wall, as in a hotel. Your pool, beachfront, dock, etc. are not shared generally. So there is extreme privacy in a villa. The point is that you have the freedom to do anything your heart desires without worrying about bothering others or them bothering you.<br/>
In a home stay you are give an entire independent villa or cottage which is directly monitored by a family staying near to the villa/ cottage who are 24hours ready to serve your needs. (Note that Ezz Villa Rentals do not enlist home stays that offers room wise accommodation that is part of the home stay owners house.  We only offer home stays that can give separate cottage or villa, at the same time all the needs of guest are catered for.)<br/><br/>
<strong>Setting</strong><br/>
By necessity, hotel rooms are grouped closely together. The settings are usually excellent. You will not have a panoramic view, however, because of the other buildings. Villas , of course, vary greatly. But they typically have a view of at least 180 degrees from left to right. Villas  or Home Stays we offer are generally higher in the hills,  on lake side, or beach side depending on your vacation  spot offering you greater views.<br/><br/>

 <strong>Interior</strong><br/>
Both hotels and villas have a wide variety of interiors, from sparse to opulent. Villas generally have more room. Most (all?) villas have a television, stereo, living room with sofas, a dining area with a table and chairs, and more space to spread out.<br/><br/>
<strong>Quiet</strong><br/> Villas and Home Stays are usually in quiet parts away from town away from main streets, with no hotel or street noise.
